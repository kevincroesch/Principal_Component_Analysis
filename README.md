# Principal Component Analysis

## Overview

We'll be untilizing principal component analysis (PCA) using a Speed Dating data set from Kaggle. PCA is often used to simplify data, reduce noise, and find unmeasured latent variables, so it's important to take the time to understand what's going on.

## Objectives
1. Explore how PCA relates to correlation.
1. Use PCA to perform dimensionality reduction.
1. Predict whether or not a speed dater likes reading based on the dater's other likes.

## Data
### Overview
> The data set we're using for this lab is a subset of a much more detailed speed dating data set. In particular, this contains no information on the actual speed dating itself (i.e., successes with or opinions of other individuals).
>
> It also contains no follow-up information where individuals are asked the same questions about themselves again. It only contains information about what an individual enjoys doing, their self-ratings on how desirable they are, and how they think others rate them based on desirability.
